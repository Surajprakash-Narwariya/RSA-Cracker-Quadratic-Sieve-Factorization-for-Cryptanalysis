# RSA-Cracker-Quadratic-Sieve-Factorization-for-Cryptanalysis
RSA-Cracker is a tool that uses the Quadratic Sieve algorithm to factor large integers and demonstrate vulnerabilities in RSA encryption. By efficiently breaking the RSA modulus, this project showcases how cryptanalysis can recover private keys, highlighting weaknesses in cryptographic security.
